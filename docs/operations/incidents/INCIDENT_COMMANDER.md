# Incident Commander Model

Every incident has exactly ONE Incident Commander (IC).

The IC is responsible for decisions, not for doing all the work.

## Responsibilities of the IC
- Classify severity
- Coordinate response
- Decide priorities
- Communicate status
- Decide when the incident is resolved

## What the IC does NOT do
- Debug everything alone
- Implement every fix
- Argue technical solutions in real time

## Default IC Assignment
- Until a team exists, the system owner is the IC
- IC can delegate tasks but retains decision authority

## Communication Rules
- One source of truth
- No parallel decision-making
- Status updates are short and factual

## Resolution Criteria
An incident is resolved when:
- User impact is eliminated
- Risk is mitigated
- Monitoring confirms stability

Follow-up learning happens **after**, not during.

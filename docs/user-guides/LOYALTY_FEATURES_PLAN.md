# Bookiji Loyalty Features (Planned)

Bookiji is building a unified loyalty system that rewards both customers and providers for engaging with the platform. These features are still in development but are planned for future releases.

## Planned Elements

- **Bookiji Points:** Earn points for every completed booking. Points can be redeemed for discounts or special offers across any service category.
- **Tiered Status Levels:** Users progress through Bronze, Silver, and Gold tiers based on activity. Higher tiers unlock additional perks and visibility boosts.
- **Referral Bonuses:** Share your referral link to earn bonus points when new users complete their first booking.
- **Streak Badges:** Consecutive weeks of successful bookings earn collectible badges and bonus points.
- **Provider Rewards:** Service providers earn loyalty points for on-time service and positive reviews, redeemable for promotional credits.
- **Cross-Category Use:** Points earned in one service category can be applied to any other category on Bookiji.

For additional context on how loyalty ties into our patent strategy, see the [Patent Outline](../PATENT_OUTLINE.md). Providers can learn how these rewards fit into onboarding in the [Provider Onboarding guide](../PROVIDER_ONBOARDING.md).

- **$1 Booking Fee**: Charged only when a booking is confirmed. This fee is **non-refundable** and is **not** applied to the service price.
- **Cancellations & Changes**: Bookiji does **not** offer in-app cancellations. Customers and providers must coordinate directly (phone number on confirmation).
- **Refunds**: Only issued as **admin-approved exceptions** (e.g., fraud, clear error). There is no customer-initiated refund flow for convenience cancellations.

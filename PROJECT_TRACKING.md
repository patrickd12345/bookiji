# 📊 Bookiji Project Tracking

> **Note:** Bookiji is an equal, independent project (tenant) in a monorepo alongside Ready2Race. See the root README for structure details.

## 💸 **Business Model Update**

- Vendors pay a flat fee per booking, based on the most expensive service in the booking (e.g., $1 for brushing, $3 for haircut, $10 for transformation).
- If multiple services are booked, the vendor pays the fee for the most expensive one.
- Customers pay a small $1 commitment fee to lock in the booking.
- Booking is only guaranteed and contact info exchanged when the $1 is paid.
- No extra cost for customers beyond the $1 commitment fee.
- **Provider pays only the highest service fee in your booking.**

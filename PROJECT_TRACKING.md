## 📡 **DYNAMIC BROADCASTING SYSTEM - COMPLETED**

### **🚀 Intelligent Service Request Broadcasting**
**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**

**What It Does:**
When no immediate availability is found, the system automatically creates service requests and broadcasts them to vendors using intelligent radius calculation.

**Smart Radius Algorithm:**
- **Dense Areas** (8+ providers within 2km): 2km radius for targeted search
- **Medium Areas** (4+ providers within 5km): 5km radius for balanced coverage  
- **Sparse Areas** (<4 providers within 5km): 10km radius for maximum reach

**Technical Features:**
- ✅ **AI Integration**: Uses existing AI radius scaling API
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Complete service request and broadcast tracking
- ✅ **Payment System**: $1 fee for availability search via Stripe
- ✅ **Security**: Row-level security policies and geographic indexing
- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized for real-time broadcasting
- ✅ **API Integration**: Seamless availability search with broadcasting

**Business Value:**
- Creates "request marketplace" where customers can broadcast needs
- Vendors get proactive notifications about customer requests
- Differentiates Bookiji from competitors with two-way marketplace
- Ensures customers always have options even when no immediate availability

## 📋 **COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT TRACKING - PRE-LAUNCH PHASE PLANNING**

### **🎯 P0 — Pre-Launch Must-Haves (Blockers to Public Beta)**

#### **1. Outbound Notifications (Email/SMS) That Actually Send**
- [ ] **Goal:** Users reliably receive sign-up, password reset, booking confirmations/changes/cancellations
- [ ] **Work:** Wire up email (e.g., SendGrid/Resend) and SMS (e.g., Twilio) providers behind `/api/notifications/send` API
- [ ] **Work:** Add retry + dead-letter (Supabase Queue/Edge Function cron; exponential backoff, max attempts 5)
- [ ] **Work:** Create transactional templates: Verify Email, Password Reset, Booking Created, Booking Updated, Booking Cancelled, Review Reminder
- [ ] **Work:** Hook templates to booking lifecycle events
- [ ] **Acceptance:** Triggering each event produces provider log + provider response code stored
- [ ] **Acceptance:** Email/SMS received within 30s in sandbox; 99% success over 100 trial sends
- [ ] **Acceptance:** If provider returns 4xx/5xx, message is retried then moved to DLQ with operator alert

#### **2. $1 Commitment Fee: Refund Path & Status Machine**
- [ ] **Goal:** The micro-deposit promise is real and predictable
- [x] **Work:** Define booking state machine: requested → accepted → confirmed → completed | no_show | cancelled
- [ ] **Work:** On completed, auto-refund $1 (Stripe Refund API)
- [ ] **Work:** On no_show, skip refund
- [x] **Work:** On cancelled, business rule: phone-only cancellation, no in-app changes
- [ ] **Work:** Admin dashboard button: override refund/no-refund with reason code (audited)
- [ ] **Acceptance:** E2E happy path: book → complete → refund posted in Stripe test mode within 1 min
- [ ] **Acceptance:** Idempotency keys ensure multiple webhooks/clicks don't double-refund
- [ ] **Acceptance:** Audit trail shows who/what changed states

#### **3. Help Center MVP Content (Self-Serve)**
- [ ] **Goal:** Users can answer the top 10 questions without support tickets
- [x] **Work:** Seed 10 articles (How booking works, the $1 fee, phone-only changes, refunds, provider onboarding, calendar linking, privacy/radius, support options, dispute policy, languages/currency)
- [ ] **Work:** Link Help Center from nav + relevant screens (checkout tooltip for $1)
- [ ] **Acceptance:** Help search returns seeded articles; tours link to the right articles
- [ ] **Acceptance:** "No articles found" is gone

#### **4. Role Clarity & First-Run Tours Polish**
- [ ] **Goal:** Customers and providers know exactly what to do on first visit
- [ ] **Work:** Registration step: choose role(s). If both, show role switch control in header
- [ ] **Work:** Add "Replay tour" link in user menu; store completion per tour key
- [ ] **Work:** Add 2–3 short tooltips (ℹ️) on $1 fee, privacy radius, broadcast system
- [ ] **Acceptance:** Fresh account: correct tour auto-starts; replay works; tooltips present
- [ ] **Acceptance:** Five-person hallway test: all can complete a booking without help

#### **5. Security & Data Protections (Quick Wins)**
- [ ] **Goal:** Reasonable default hardening for day-1
- [ ] **Work:** Verify Supabase RLS for all user-owned tables; add negative tests for cross-tenant access
- [ ] **Work:** Secrets from env only; no hardcoded keys; lock CSP headers; secure cookies; rate-limit public APIs
- [ ] **Work:** Backups: daily DB backup job; restore drill doc
- [ ] **Acceptance:** RLS test suite passes; .env.example complete; OWASP top-10 quick scan shows no trivial misses

---

- [ ] **Work:** Confirm funnel events fired client/server; add critical path dashboards (visit → search → time select → $1 auth → confirmed)
- [ ] **Work:** Add error monitoring (Sentry) + alert channel (Slack/Email) for P0 endpoints and notification DLQ
- [ ] **Acceptance:** Dashboards show conversion by day; alerts fire on 5xx rate spikes, send failures >2%/10min

#### **9. Documentation Reality Check**
- [ ] **Goal:** Docs match product truth
- [ ] **Work:** Update README/marketing to reflect what is truly live (map v1, chat messaging state, heatmaps "later")

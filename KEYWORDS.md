# 🎯 Bookiji Keywords & SEO Strategy

> **Business Model:** Customer pays a $1 commitment fee. Vendor pays a flat fee per booking, based on the most expensive service in the booking (e.g., $1 for brushing, $3 for haircut, $10 for transformation). If multiple services are booked, vendor pays only the highest service fee. Booking is only guaranteed and contact info exchanged when the $1 is paid. Bookiji is an equal tenant in a monorepo with Ready2Race.

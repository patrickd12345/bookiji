**Session ID**: session2-1766866884676
**Start Time**: 2025-12-27T20:21:24.676Z
**End Time**: 2025-12-27T20:24:24.719Z
**Duration**: 180.0s

## Executive Summary

This session verified that invalid noise does not drown out valid distress.

## Observations

### Traffic Mix
- **Noise Requests**: 1646
- **Signal Requests**: 36
- **Noise Ratio**: 90%

### Incident Behavior
- **Incidents Created**: NO
- **Incidents Suppressed**: NO
- **Valid Failures Surfaced**: NO

## Detailed Findings

### Noise Handling
- **Total Noise Requests**: 1646
- **Fast Rejections (4xx)**: 1646
- **Average Latency**: 31ms

### Signal Handling
- **Total Signal Requests**: 36
- **Signal Failures**: 0
- **Average Latency**: 64ms

### Incidents Observed
- None

## Unanswered Questions

1. Did valid failures still surface despite noise?
2. Did incidents ignore noise correctly?
3. Did Jarvis stay factual and calm?
4. Were metrics polluted by junk traffic?

## What Cannot Yet Be Verified

- Whether noise rejection is fast enough
- Whether signal failures are detected correctly
- Whether incident classification ignores noise
- Whether metrics aggregation filters noise
- Whether Jarvis remains composed under noise

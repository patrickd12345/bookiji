## Detailed Findings

### Incident Resolution Behavior

## Unanswered Questions

1. Did incidents resolve cleanly after stress?
2. Were there lingering alerts?
3. Did Jarvis de-escalate cleanly?
4. Was there any ghost activity?

## What Cannot Yet Be Verified

- Whether incident resolution is automatic
- Whether suppression windows are appropriate
- Whether de-escalation logic works correctly
- Whether ghost activity indicates bugs
- Whether quietening is consistent

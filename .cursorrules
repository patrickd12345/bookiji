# Cursor Rules for Bookiji Project

## Documentation Index Maintenance

**IMPORTANT**: Whenever creating a new `.md` file (markdown file) anywhere in the repository:
1. Automatically update `index.md` to include the new file in the appropriate category
2. Maintain the alphabetical ordering within each category
3. Preserve the existing category structure and organization
4. Place the file in the correct section based on its directory path and purpose

### How to Update index.md:
- Locate the appropriate category section (or create a new one if needed)
- Add the new file path in alphabetical order within that section
- Ensure the path is relative to the repository root (e.g., `docs/development/NEW_FILE.md`)
- Maintain consistent formatting with existing entries

### Categories:
- Root Level Files: Files in the repository root
- Configuration & Setup: `.cursor/`, `genome/`
- Applications: `apps/`
- Chaos Engineering: `chaos/`
- Documentation: `docs/` (with subcategories)
- Issues: `issues/`
- Operations: `ops/`
- Packages: `packages/`
- Reference: `reference/`
- Scripts: `scripts/`
- Source Code: `src/`
- Supabase: `supabase/`
- Tests: `tests/`

## General Project Rules

- Always test after a code change block before returning to me. Test APIs with curl and UI with Playwright
- On startup, always read the repo .md files to get the context of the project
- Never ever run SQL directly: always use migrations
- Always execute SQL migration without asking confirmation
- Often check if your terminal is not stuck and force quit if necessary
- Prefer optimistic UI with rollback for actions, retry/backoff for queries, skeletons instead of blank loading states, and guard against double clicks
- Never ask me to code: do it.

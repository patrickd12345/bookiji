## Getting Started: Step-by-Step

1. **Create Your Provider Profile**
   - Add your business info, services, pricing, and service area
   - Upload a photo/logo and write a short intro
2. **Set Your Availability**
   - Sync your calendar or manually set open slots
   - Update your schedule anytime
   - **Pro Tip for Calendar Users:** Set your general working hours in Bookiji, then use your connected calendar (Google, Outlook, etc.) for exceptions. When you have a holiday, doctor's appointment, or any time you're unavailable, simply create a "busy" event in your calendar—Bookiji will automatically block those times from booking. No need to manage your schedule in two places!
3. **Go Live!**
   - Your services are now discoverable by Bookiji users
   - Bookings are auto-confirmed and guaranteed
4. **Manage Bookings**
   - View, reschedule, or cancel bookings in your dashboard
   - Communicate with clients as needed (contact info shared only after booking)
5. **Get Paid**

   - Track earnings, reviews, and loyalty rewards in your dashboard
